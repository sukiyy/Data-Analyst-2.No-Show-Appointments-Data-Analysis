# Udacity-Data-Analyst-2.No-Show-Appointments-Data-Analysis

This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row. ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital. ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família. For the now show column, it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up. We will figure out the important factors for patient not show up the appointmnet in this project. Does sms_received remind patient to show up the scheduled appointment? Does the type of the diseases affect the show up rate for the appointment? Does scholarship affect the no show rate for the appointment? Does gender affect the no show rate for the appointment?
